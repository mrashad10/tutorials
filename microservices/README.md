## Introduction

This project serves as a practical guide to designing and deploying a
microservice-based application. It focuses on best practices in microservice
development, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

## Features

- **Microservices**: Demonstrates the design and development of independent microservices.
- **Dockerized Services**: Each microservice is containerized with Docker, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Utilizes Kubernetes for orchestrating and managing containers in a cluster.
- **Service Discovery**: Implements service discovery and load balancing within the Kubernetes environment.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Includes a basic setup for logging and monitoring microservices.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Redis (optional, for caching)
- Prometheus (optional, for monitoring)
